# How to contribute
Although it's a small project we at inausoft are always welcoming changes - so go ahead fix some issues and create new features!

## Working on issue
Please work only on the issues included in the next milestone. Be sure to assign yourself to an issue if you're in progress of getting it done. If for whatever reason you're not able to finish please unassign yourself.

We're using [simple branching](http://inausoft.com/blog/simple-branching) when it comes to branching, merging and versioning.

There a small set of unit tests available - so be sure to run / adjust / add them before you will create your pull request.

Working on the .net CLI prerequisites:
- .net 6

If you have spotted a bug or documentation mistake / inconsitance - please raise an issue using existing `bug_report.md` and try to fill in as many details as possible.

## Sharing an idea

for the next release.
